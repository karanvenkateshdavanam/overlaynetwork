Hi group1,

Good job with your simulations. A small comment would be to generate Monte-Carlo simulations by varying the no. of users and no. of nodes.

Your grade for HW3 is 16%.

Comments:
+3% for the usage of typed Behaviors model for Akka actors.
+3% for a documenting your implementation and execution steps.
